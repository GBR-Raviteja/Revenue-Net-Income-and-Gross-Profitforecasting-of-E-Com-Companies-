# Revenue, Net Income, and Gross Profit Forecasting of E-Com Companies

This Project investigates forecasting the revenue, net income, and gross profit of Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart using Time Series models (ARIMA, SARIMA) and Deep Learning (DNN, GRU, BiLSTM). Results show SARIMA performs best for seasonal data. The work compares models and discusses future improvements with larger datasets.

## Key Points
- Data collected via web scraping for 2009-2022 (Walmart, Amazon), 2013-2022 (Alibaba)
- Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, DNN, GRU, BiLSTM
- Metrics: RMSE for each company/model
- SARIMA yields best performance on seasonal datasets
- Suggestions for further research with more data
